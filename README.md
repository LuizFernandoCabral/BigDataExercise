## Program that predicts which number is from some hand written numbers

Neural network learn which number is which from labeled train set

Neural network predicts output with given input (using the same train set)

Using external made function to optimize (faster) calculations and to display data

Data obatined from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Data (mnist_all.mat) pre-processed in different program and saved as data1.mat file

Some pictures from the output of the program:
